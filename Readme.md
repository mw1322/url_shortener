# URL Shortener Application

Welcome to the URL Shortener Application! This industry-standard project allows users to generate shortened links for their website URLs. When a user clicks on the shortened URL, they are redirected to the original website.

## Features

- **URL Shortening:** Convert long URLs into short, shareable links.
- **Redirection:** Redirect users from shortened links to the original website.
- **Analytics Tracking:** Track user interactions with shortened links, including:
  - Number of clicks
  - Timestamp of each click

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>


2. **Topics that I learned:**
  Stateless Authentication: This is a technique where the server does not store any session state. Instead, each request from the client must include all the information needed for authentication. This approach often uses tokens that are validated with each request.
